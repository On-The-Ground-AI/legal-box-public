## HOW TO USE THESE PROMPTS EFFECTIVELY (SAL PRINCIPLES)

Before using any prompt below, add these elements for better results:

1. **Your role and context:** "I am a [lawyer/in-house counsel/paralegal] acting for [PARTY] in a [jurisdiction] matter."
2. **Source boundary:** "Restrict your analysis to the attached contract only. Do not reference external sources or make assumptions beyond its contents. Provide pinpoint clause references."
3. **Chain-of-thought:** For complex analysis, add "Think through this step-by-step."
4. **Verification reminder (for yourself):** Verify all legal conclusions and citations before use. You remain responsible for your work product.

These additions take 30 seconds and significantly improve output accuracy and defensibility.

Context: Use for minor, temporary, or exception-based variations to a contract without formally amending it.

### F.1 — CLEAN DRAFT MSA FROM NEGOTIATION RECORD (SINGAPORE LAW)

*Source: SAL Guide, New Prompts (2nd Edition)*

I am a lawyer advising on a transaction governed by Singapore law. I want to update the attached Master Services Agreement (MSA) to incorporate all negotiated changes reflected in the accompanying email chain/summary, and produce a clean, execution-ready draft.

The deliverable is a clean, revised version of the MSA that accurately reflects these agreed amendments. You must ensure that:
- All defined terms are used correctly
- The revisions do not result in internal contradictions within the agreement
- No new substantive legal terms are introduced or clauses modified that were not subject to negotiation
- The original formatting and clause numbering is maintained, unless specific changes require re-numbering

Use only these materials:
- Base document: original MSA (.docx)
- Negotiation record: email chain or a summary document listing each agreed change

Where attachments are referenced, restrict analysis and drafting to those materials and provide pinpoint references where applicable.

**Context:** Singapore law commercial contracts — post-negotiation clean draft
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Best AI tool:** Claude (document attachment required)
**Tips:** For long MSAs, first ask the AI to list all the changes it identified from the email chain. Verify them, then proceed to the clean draft in a second prompt.

### F.2 — TENANCY AGREEMENT FROM LETTER OF INTENT (SINGAPORE)

*Source: SAL Guide, New Prompts (2nd Edition)*

I am a paralegal in a real estate practice group in Singapore. We have received a signed Letter of Intent (LOI) from the landlord and prospective tenant. My task is to draft the first version of the Tenancy Agreement (TA) for the landlord's review.

Prepare a complete Tenancy Agreement (TA) from the attached Letter of Intent (LOI), using the firm's TA template provided. Systematically populate the template with:
- Full names and UEN/NRIC of the Landlord and Tenant
- Address of the demised premises
- Lease term (commencement and expiry dates)
- Monthly rent and any rent-free period
- Security deposit amount
- Permitted use of the premises
- Any option to renew
- Responsibility for stamp duty and legal costs

At the end of the draft, insert a section titled **"Review Notes for Solicitor"** flagging:
1. Any terms in the LOI that deviate from the standard template (e.g. an unusual break clause)
2. Any standard clauses in the template not addressed in the LOI (e.g. silence on reinstatement obligations)

Do not alter any standard legal clauses in the template unless the LOI specifically requires it.

Use only:
- Core Terms: [Attach the signed Letter of Intent (LOI)]
- Base Document: [Attach the firm's standard commercial Tenancy Agreement template]

Where attachments are referenced, restrict analysis and drafting to those materials and provide pinpoint references.

### F.3 — JOINT VENTURE TERM SHEET FROM MOU (SINGAPORE)

*Source: SAL Guide, New Prompts (2nd Edition)*

I am a corporate lawyer advising on a new Joint Venture (JV) transaction. Our client has signed a high-level Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with a potential JV partner. I need to draft a comprehensive, non-binding Term Sheet to form the basis for drafting the definitive JV Agreement.

Prepare a detailed Joint Venture Term Sheet by populating the firm's standard template using the commercial terms in the attached MOU. Translate the high-level MOU principles into the appropriate detailed clauses of the Term Sheet.

Pay close attention to:
- Names of the JV partners; the business objective of the JV
- Each party's capital contributions (form and amount)
- Proposed ownership percentages
- Governance arrangements including board composition, voting rights, and management appointments
- Any agreed mechanisms for deadlock or dispute resolution

At the end of the document, include a **"Points for Discussion"** section listing any standard commercial or legal terms not addressed in the MOU (e.g. IP licensing, dividend policy, exit scenarios, restrictive covenants).

The Term Sheet must clearly state it is non-binding, except for Confidentiality and Governing Law. Do not invent or infer commercial terms; missing information should go under "Points for Discussion" rather than be filled in.

Use only: [MOU, term sheet template]

Where attachments are referenced, restrict analysis and drafting to those materials with pinpoint references.
